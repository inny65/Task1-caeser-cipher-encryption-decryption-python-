# Task1-caeser-cipher-encryption-decryption-python-
This  project is a simple python based Caesar cipher encryption and decryption tool.
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the characters in a message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.
This project allows users to input a message, select the shift value, and either encrypt or decrypt the message.

Features includes:
- Encrypt messages: Convert plain text into cipher text using a shift value.
- Decrypt messages: Convert cipher text back into readable plain text by reversing the shift.
- 
 How It Works
1. The user is prompted to choose between encrypting or decrypting a message.
2. The user enters a message and a shift value (number of positions to shift letters in the alphabet).
3. The program processes the message based on the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
4. The output is displayed as either an encrypted or decrypted message.
